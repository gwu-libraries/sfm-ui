excerpt: "We're pleased to share some recently-developed guidelines on building social media archives."

---

As part our project supported by the National Historical Publications and Records Commission, we have developed
guidelines on collection development for social media archiving programs. We are pleased
to present this resource, ["Building Social Media Archives: Collection
Development Guidelines"]({{ site.github.url }}/resources/guidelines).


Although there are many technical methods for collecting social media, these guidelines
are particularly concerned with approaches that capture the underlying data behind social
media platforms, via platforms' APIs. Such approaches present both a powerful potential for
documenting a record of our cultural heritage, as well as a challenging set of legal,
ethical, technical, and programmatic needs and norms.

This document seeks to surface issues potentially facing cultural heritage institutions
and guide those institutions through a series of questions to consider and, where appropriate,
to develop explicit policies to address these issues.

Development of the guidelines was led by Christie Peterson, Vakil Smallen, Rachel Trent, with contributions from Elisabeth Kaplan, Dan Kerchner, Justin Littman, and Laura Wrubel.
